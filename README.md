## Ranking explanation

[What makes a good video game](https://dailytrojan.com/2023/01/27/free-play-what-makes-a-good-video-game/)

I prioritize **replayability** when selecting games, as it's the key factor that keeps me engaged. Games with depth in replayability, like ‚ÄúElden Ring,‚Äù offer new experiences each time, while others compensate with strong narratives or unique modes. Ultimately, the ability to return to a game repeatedly determines its quality and staying power in my library.

| Rating     | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üöÆ         | Not worth the time.                                                                                                      |
| ‚≠ê         | has too many flaws or has no replayability => uninstall early.                            |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê        | does deliver what the genre demands but not polished or lack innovation. => uninstall early.     |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       | High quality compared to other games in the same genre. => uninstall after finishing.   |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê      | Entertaining, has replayability. => keep                                                                                     |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê     | Masterpiece that you need to play before you die, can be replayed constantly. => keep |

## üì± Mobile

- Wild Rift (Mobile) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí fair game, only thing costs money are cosmetics, bad team will make you mad in public games
- Crusader Quest (Mobile) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí not Pay2Win, very well written story, decent events, many heroes to choose and assemble into a 3-man team, innovative gameplay

## üëØ Multiplayer

- Warframe ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí Space ninjas, fair game, a lot less Pay2Win, fast/smooth movement, a lot of customizations and builds, great community
- MapleStory  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí too many classes, highly dependent on tier list, gearing can be problematic due to high cost from cubing/star force. Fun game but the grind is not for everyone. Highly recommend playing on Reboot to avoid Pay2Win
- The Finals  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí  very innovative with destructible buildings, interesting game modes and maps, suffered from cheaters like most FPS.
- Counter Strike 2 / CS:GO  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí not casual friendly, mostly appeal to older players who gamble for expensive skins, knives, etc.

## Why Concord failed?

Concord, a $200M game from Sony, launched on August 23, 2024, but failed spectacularly, shutting down just 12 days later due to critical flaws.

Highlights
- üöÄ Launch Failure: Concord had less than 700 players on day one, dropping below 100 by day ten.
- üìâ Unprecedented Cancellation: Sony announced the game‚Äôs termination 12 days post-launch, marking a record for AAA game lifespan.
- üí∞ Massive Budget: The game had a staggering $200 million budget, exceeding many blockbuster films‚Äô costs.
- üéÆ Market Misalignment: Launched into a saturated hero shooter market, Concord offered nothing new to stand out.
- üîÑ Development Delays: Eight years of development led to outdated technology and missed market trends.
- üíî Character Design Crisis: Characters were criticized for being generic and unappealing, failing to connect with players.
- üí∏ Pricing Miscalculation: A $40 price tag in a free-to-play market proved to be a significant barrier to entry.
Key Insights
- üöß Market Myopia: Concord‚Äôs developers ignored the oversaturated hero shooter market, lacking a unique selling point to attract players. This resulted in poor visibility and interest.
- ‚è≥ Prolonged Development Risks: The eight-year development cycle led to technological stagnation and missed opportunities to innovate, ultimately resulting in a product that felt outdated and irrelevant.
- üé≠ Character Appeal: Characters should resonate with players through unique personalities and visual designs. Concord‚Äôs failure to create memorable characters contributed to its lack of engagement.
- üíµ Budget Allocation: Misallocation of the $200 million budget focused on flashy cinematics rather than core gameplay elements, failing to enhance player experience.
- üìä Inflexible Pricing Strategy: By charging $40 in a market dominated by free-to-play titles, Concord misjudged player expectations, leading to low initial engagement.
- üì£ Ineffective Marketing: A last-minute marketing approach failed to build community excitement or generate awareness, resulting in poor pre-launch buzz.
- üß® Legacy Pressure: The developers‚Äô past successes created unrealistic expectations, leading to a game that couldn‚Äôt meet industry standards or innovate effectively.

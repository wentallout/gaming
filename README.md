## Ranking explanation

- The most important quality of a good video game is how it deliver its most important features. Example: Combat games need to have deep combat, puzzle games need to be satisfying.
- I do not use graphics to measure good games.
- Good music/sound and unique art style always enhance video games.
- UX problems do exist on high quality games => will ignore unless it's too annoying.

## Trends in modern video games

- There has been a lot of negativity whenever a new 5v5/Hero-shooter/Battle Royale shows up.
- Gamers don't like when there are blatant wokeness/politics in their games.
- Gamers will not play your game if the character design is intentionally ugly (example: Concord).
- Pay2Win is unacceptable in 2024. Mobile gacha games rely heavily on this but sometimes its design is fair enough that the game won't be closed after 1 month.

## 📱 Mobile

- Wild Rift (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐ → fair game, only thing costs money are cosmetics, bad team will make you mad in public games
- Crusader Quest (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → not Pay2Win, very well written story, decent events, many heroes to choose and assemble into a 3-man team, innovative gameplay

## 👯 Multiplayer

- Warframe ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → Space ninjas, fair game, a lot less Pay2Win, fast/smooth movement, a lot of customizations and builds, great community
- MapleStory  ⭐⭐⭐ → too many classes, highly dependent on tier list, gearing can be problematic due to high cost from cubing/star force. Fun game but the grind is not for everyone. Highly recommend playing on Reboot to avoid Pay2Win
- The Finals  ⭐⭐⭐⭐ →  very innovative with destructible buildings, interesting game modes and maps, suffered from cheaters like most FPS.
- Counter Strike 2 / CS:GO  ⭐ → not casual friendly, mostly appeal to older players who gamble for expensive skins, knives, etc.

## Why Concord failed?

Concord, a $200M game from Sony, launched on August 23, 2024, but failed spectacularly, shutting down just 12 days later due to critical flaws.

Highlights
- 🚀 Launch Failure: Concord had less than 700 players on day one, dropping below 100 by day ten.
- 📉 Unprecedented Cancellation: Sony announced the game’s termination 12 days post-launch, marking a record for AAA game lifespan.
- 💰 Massive Budget: The game had a staggering $200 million budget, exceeding many blockbuster films’ costs.
- 🎮 Market Misalignment: Launched into a saturated hero shooter market, Concord offered nothing new to stand out.
- 🔄 Development Delays: Eight years of development led to outdated technology and missed market trends.
- 💔 Character Design Crisis: Characters were criticized for being generic and unappealing, failing to connect with players.
- 💸 Pricing Miscalculation: A $40 price tag in a free-to-play market proved to be a significant barrier to entry.
Key Insights
- 🚧 Market Myopia: Concord’s developers ignored the oversaturated hero shooter market, lacking a unique selling point to attract players. This resulted in poor visibility and interest.
- ⏳ Prolonged Development Risks: The eight-year development cycle led to technological stagnation and missed opportunities to innovate, ultimately resulting in a product that felt outdated and irrelevant.
- 🎭 Character Appeal: Characters should resonate with players through unique personalities and visual designs. Concord’s failure to create memorable characters contributed to its lack of engagement.
- 💵 Budget Allocation: Misallocation of the $200 million budget focused on flashy cinematics rather than core gameplay elements, failing to enhance player experience.
- 📊 Inflexible Pricing Strategy: By charging $40 in a market dominated by free-to-play titles, Concord misjudged player expectations, leading to low initial engagement.
- 📣 Ineffective Marketing: A last-minute marketing approach failed to build community excitement or generate awareness, resulting in poor pre-launch buzz.
- 🧨 Legacy Pressure: The developers’ past successes created unrealistic expectations, leading to a game that couldn’t meet industry standards or innovate effectively.

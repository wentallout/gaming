## 😍 Daily

- Warframe (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → Space ninjas, fair game, a lot less Pay2Win, fast/smooth movement, a lot of customizations and builds, great community
- Hades 2 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → Another masterpiece like Hades 1, great voice acting and story

## 📱 Mobile

- Wild Rift (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐ → fair game, only thing costs money are cosmetics, bad team will make you mad in public games
- Crusader Quest (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → not Pay2Win, very well written story, decent events, many heroes to choose and assemble into a 3-man team, innovative gameplay


## 👯 Multiplayer

- MapleStory (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → too many classes, highly dependent on tier list, gearing can be problematic due to high cost from cubing/star force. Fun game but the grind is not for everyone. Highly recommend playing on Reboot to avoid Pay2Win
- The Finals (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ →  very innovative with destructible buildings, interesting game modes and maps, suffered from cheaters like most FPS.
- Counter Strike 2 / CS:GO (PC) ⭐ → not casual friendly, mostly appeal to older players who gamble for expensive skins, knives, etc.

## 🏁 Completed

- Hades ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → **GOTY**, incredible story, voice acting and music, fun replayable gameplay with random upgrades, top tier rogue-like,
- God of War ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → **GOTY**
- Devil May Cry 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → I mostly play Vergil, other characters require too much input to work well

- Trepang2 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐ - great physics and gunfight, let players do amazing slowmo constantly. very F.E.A.R

- Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza: Like a Dragon ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ →
- Katana ZERO (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → amazing game but too short, great story, fast and impactful combat, needs trial-and-error to beat difficult stage

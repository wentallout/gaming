## Ranking explanation

- The most important quality of a good video game is how it deliver its most important features. Example: Combat games need to have deep combat, puzzle games need to be satisfying.
- I do not use graphics to measure good games.
- Good music/sound and unique art style always enhance video games.
- UX problems do exist on high quality games => will ignore unless it's too annoying.

## Trends in modern video games

- There has been a lot of negativity whenever a new 5v5/Hero-shooter/Battle Royale shows up.
- Gamers don't like when there are blatant wokeness/politics in their games.
- Gamers will not play your game if the character design is intentionally ugly (example: Concord).
- Pay2Win is unacceptable in 2024. Mobile gacha games rely heavily on this but sometimes its design is fair enough that the game won't be closed after 1 month.

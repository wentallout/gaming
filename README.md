## üòç Daily

- Warframe (PC) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí Space ninjas, fair game, a lot less Pay2Win, fast/smooth movement, a lot of customizations and builds, great community
- Hades 2 (PC) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí Another masterpiece like Hades 1, great voice acting and story

## üì± Mobile

- Wild Rift (Mobile) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí fair game, only thing costs money are cosmetics, bad team will make you mad in public games

## üëØ Multiplayer

- MapleStory (PC) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Üí too many classes, highly dependent on tier list, gearing can be problematic due to high cost from cubing/star force. Fun game but the grind is not for everyone. Highly recommend playing on Reboot to avoid Pay2Win

# 🎮 Khoa's favorite video games list (Updated June 2024)

## Ranking explanation

- The most important quality of a good video game is how it deliver its most important feature. Example: Combat games need to have deep combat, puzzle games need to be satisfying.
- I do not use graphics to measure good games.
- Good music/sound and unique art style always enhance video games.
- UX problems do exist on high quality games => will ignore unless it's too annoying.

⭐: has too many flaws, overrated or has no replayability => might uninstall early.
⭐⭐: playable but not polished enough, => might uninstall but only after finishing.
⭐⭐⭐: acceptable quality
⭐⭐⭐⭐: entertaining, has replayability
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: masterpiece that you need to play before you die, can be replayed constantly, can keep for a long time without uninstallation. Usually GOTY winners with good story.

## 😍 Daily

- Warframe (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → Space ninjas, fair game, a lot less Pay2Win, fast/smooth movement, a lot of customizations and builds, great community

## 📱 Mobile

- Wild Rift (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐ → fair game, only thing costs money are cosmetics, bad team will make you mad in public games
- Crusader Quest (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → not Pay2Win, very well written story, decent events, many heroes to choose and assemble into a 3-man team, innovative gameplay

## 👯 Multiplayer

- MapleStory (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → too many classes, highly dependent on tier list, gearing can be problematic due to high cost from cubing/star force. Fun game but the grind is not for everyone. Highly recommend playing on Reboot to avoid Pay2Win
- The Finals (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ →  very innovative with destructible buildings, interesting game modes and maps, suffered from cheaters like most FPS.

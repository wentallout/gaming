## 😍 Daily

- Warframe (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → Space ninjas, fair game, a lot less Pay2Win, fast/smooth movement, a lot of customizations and builds, great community


## 📱 Mobile

- Wild Rift (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐ → fair game, only thing costs money are cosmetics, bad team will make you mad in public games
- Crusader Quest (Mobile) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → not Pay2Win, very well written story, decent events, many heroes to choose and assemble into a 3-man team, innovative gameplay


## 👯 Multiplayer

- MapleStory (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → too many classes, highly dependent on tier list, gearing can be problematic due to high cost from cubing/star force. Fun game but the grind is not for everyone. Highly recommend playing on Reboot to avoid Pay2Win
- The Finals (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ →  very innovative with destructible buildings, interesting game modes and maps, suffered from cheaters like most FPS.
- Counter Strike 2 / CS:GO (PC) ⭐ → not casual friendly, mostly appeal to older players who gamble for expensive skins, knives, etc.

## 🏁 Completed

- Granblue Fantasy: Relink ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Good combat
- Hades (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → **GOTY**, incredible story, voice acting and music, fun replayable gameplay with random upgrades, top tier rogue-like.
- Hades 2 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → Another masterpiece like Hades 1, great voice acting and story
- God of War ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → **GOTY**
- Devil May Cry 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → I mostly play Vergil, other characters require too much input to work well
- Shadow Warrior 3 ⭐ - lil bit lackluster, compared to 2th might be a step down
- The Outer World (Obsidian Entertainment) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → better than most space game I've seen, great story, gameplay is smooth and chill
- Wolfenstein: The New Order (PC)
- Resident Evil 6, Resident Evil 2 remake, Resident Evil 7 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐ → overrated but fun I guess
- Dying Light (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → great physics, generic zombie story but still interesting, great parkour movement, gunplay feels good
- Trepang2 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐ - great physics and gunfight, let players do amazing slowmo constantly. very F.E.A.R
- Risk of Rain 1, Risk of Rain 2 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - you're stranded on a planet, pickup strange items to get stronger, survive massive monster wave, if you die you lose everything, great music, high replayability
- ULTRAKILL ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → very fast-paced gameplay, all sorts of wacky guns and tricks, graphics is simple, low-poly, bosses are aggressive. 
- BioShock Infinite ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → old masterpiece
- Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza: Like a Dragon ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ →
- Katana ZERO (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → amazing game but too short, great story, fast and impactful combat, needs trial-and-error to beat difficult stage
- Hotline Miami 1,2 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → violent and fast combat, bossing is weird, fantastic music, needs trial-and-error to beat difficult stage
- Dishonored 1,2 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → king of stealth games, needs trial-and-error to clear stages, very skill-demanding
- Borderlands 1,2,3 (PC) ⭐⭐⭐ → king of looter-shooter genre, gets repetitive at the end

- OTXO (PC) ⭐⭐⭐ → hotline miami with rogue-like features, not bad
- Enter the Gungeon (PC) ⭐⭐⭐ → a little bit too hard for my taste, repetitive gameplay, fun guns don't come easily
- Ys IX: Monstrum Nox (PC) ⭐⭐⭐
- Skul: The Hero Slayer (PC) ⭐⭐⭐ →  roguelike-action platformer that lets you control a cute skeleton that can swap heads to get different abilities and skill sets, high replayability
- Bayonnetta 1,2,3 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → great hack n slash alternative to DMC, deep combat system but easy to pick up
- Need for Speed™ Most Wanted ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → true classic of the 2K era, racing outlaws, hot girls, great police radio and chase, make players feel the speed correctly
- Terraria (PC) ⭐⭐⭐
